# PHP ShapeFile

#### PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS FORK - THE UPSTREAM LIBRARY CAN NOW WRITE SHAPEFILES ####

**This fork was originally created when Gaspare's library could not write shapefiles, however since version 3.0 it can write. You should go use that code, it is better maintained and documented.**
